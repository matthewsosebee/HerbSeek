# HerbSeek
HerbSeek - App that shows nearby sightings of herbs to end users and allows them to publish their own sightings for other users to view.

This app is an **IN-PROGRESS** implemention using the following technologies:

Database = PostgreSQL 17

Front-end = Javascript + React + MUI components

Back-end (Database API) = Java + Spring Boot

TODOs:

1. Modify CSS to improve design of the front-end.
2. Reorganize components for better visibility.
3. Include more detail for each herb sighting.
